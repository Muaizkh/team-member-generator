# Team Member Generator

## Description

This github repo shows how to create a backend Team Member generator. The motivation of this was to allow for easier creation of a team page and allowing myself and other to update it on the backend rather than the front. I built this as a way to test my backend writing skill as well as making use of the node function that is in VSCode to allow for a more diverse oppotunity to create different styled pages. The problem I learnt to solve is how to make all the pages flow together and even though I was unsuccessful I attempted it and have a better understanding of creating pages and tests.
